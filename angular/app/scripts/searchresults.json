Graham and I had worked - decided we couldn't understand actually why we weren't attracting young talent into the firm and our friend, Noel Robinson, always seemed to be attracting really talented young people into the firm, so, with a marriage broker being [Dick Ferris] the planner who'd worked with us many years before, we engineered an amalgamation of the practices in '87. I, as I said earlier, I'm still friends with Noel, but he's not someone who's easy to have as a partner and he was - Graham Bligh became quite disturbed about the way things were happening, so in '89 we busted that relationship and that's when Bligh Voller came into being. That led to some interesting times. 00:37:52 We had a bit of a struggle surviving through '90 but by '91 we were up and running and we just had a - well, the firms just gone from strength to strength since then.",

We did a few but we couldn't bust into the big boys area like Conrad and Gargett were doing a lot of that work, in those days, the big hospitals and through that relationship, it was decided that when Lawrence stopped being a professor and was looking - after five years or so - looking towards getting his practice into a healthy state, we thought, okay, let's come together. 00:41:28 That was a big turning point for that practice because suddenly we had more kudos in Brisbane.

That was the way Arthur Bligh thought, you know, e.g. the Roma Street plan which was well known in the period you were talking about and was something together with [Rider Hunt] and another financial institution they did for the city and some of it was implemented. Unfortunately, not applied to [01:03:35] but that's fine. 01:03:39 Really, you can see the end result of that thinking it's happened that way - down that part of town. Yes, so - - -",

We made the running in the firm for most of that time and my relationship with Graham is still very close - although we don't see each other a lot - and in reflection I think a lot of things between us were unspoken, but we knew the way - we understood how each other thought and what each other's strengths were and where to lean on them.

The retirement village at Hervey Bay and Kianga, there’s a hall at Kianga, memorial hall at Kianga, after the mine disaster. 00:40:43 Those were the things that I was involved in every stage. I was involved quite a lot in the design, with Graham, in the design of buildings, but then those others I sort of was all the way through, was involved with him on our entry to the Queensland Art Gallery.

Bligh Site: Sloping down to the north, the block of 38 perches is on the perimeter of and looks down on a tree covered valley of five acre parcels of land. A small creek trickles through the lower end of the site. Adjacent blocks were undeveloped at the time of building. Planning: Of prime importance was a house that worked according to the manner of living of the family unit with three young boys, and a house that would be interesting for the children, allowing for alterations as the manner of living changed at certain stages. The slope of the site, aspect and surroundings basically led to the form, comprising five levels and timber structure. Provision for ample air movement together with the influence of interest and various levels led to consideration of internal spaces as related units. affording changing views within and out of the building. Varying light values add to the internal character. Future alterations wil l involve the conversion of the dormitory into three separate rooms enclosing of the lower open play area as a play room. Later the dormitory will become a casual lounge and visitors' room, and a boys' block built some 30ft away amongst trees above the creek and connected across the lawn by an access bridge to the verandah. Finish: To create a minimum of maintenance the exterior is sheeted in copper-chromate impregnated Spotted Gum weatherboard and the walls throughout the interior are sheeted in dressed Spotted Gum open rebated at the joint and naturally finished. Floors of Crows Ash wil l eventually be carpeted. Natural fibreboard is used as a ceiling finish.

Ryan The clients, a central Queensland pastoralist couple, wish to establish a city residence where they would spend several months of the year until eventually taking up residence of a more permanent nature. Requirements called for a two bedroom home within a specified budget, with a separate casual study-lounge adjacent to the kitchen, and a lounge dining room with fireplace. With the home a second unit was required for future family use, which at present is occupied as a fiat to give some degree of protection to the main unit during the owner's absence. The atmosphere of being amongst trees was felt desirable and provision was to be made for privacy and to benefit from prevailing breezes. Towards the end of the job, the units were completely insect screened. Landscaping called for a scheme that required low maintenance and for this, native plants were used. AREA OF SITE: 32 perches. OVERALL DIMENSIONS OF BUILDING: 78ft x 27ft NUMBER OF FLOORS: 1. TOTAL AREA OF BUILDING: 2,720 sq. ft (Main Unit 1,400 sq. ft; Second Unit 560 sq. ft; Balcony 210 sq. ft; Garages 550 sq. ft).

The domestic field is still the last bastion of Queensland's architectural identity and the results by Commonwealth standards are good. Here is illustrated a typical cross-section of wort produced recently, which shows an apt sense of domestic realities and of the vernacular tradition of the North: House at St. Lucia, Brisbane. Archt: Graham Bligh of Bligh, Jessup Bretnall & Partners. Asbestos cement infill panels with post and beam construction. Concrete tile roof. Landscape design by Architect B. Ryan. House at Mt. Coot-tha, Brisbane. Archt. John Dalton. Cone, block foundation walls, oiled timber walls above, steel deck roof with clearstory ventilation at roof level, 8 ft. long metal blades. Photo: L. & D. Keen House at Indooroopilly, Brisbane. Archt: Campbell Scott of Hayes & Scott. Small house embodying the traditional stumps and verandah on three sides. Hip beams expressed at roof level and rafters hung from the underside. House at Kenmore, Q'land. Archt: M. Hurst of Lund, Hutton & Newell. Oiled weatherboard fascia and cone, block walls. f By contrast with these Q'land houses, the two public buildings illustrated below are dour and uncertain, giving a token recognition of their environment but not generally distinguishable from their counterparts in any other State in Australia: The Social Sciences Building, University of Queensland, faces West. It has vertical and horizontal sun control. Goodsir & Carlyle, archts; Alexander Brown & Cambridge & Assoc, str. engrs; A. E. Axon & Assoc, mech. engr; J. H. B. Kerr, q. surveyor. Metropolitan Fire Brigade Station, Kemp Place, Brisbane Conrad & Gargett, archts. H 'English as she is spoke': a recent article in Readers' Digest on the work of Nervi perpetuates the wretched phraso \"eye-catching\" (a contemporary writer enquires as to the need for this optical barbed-wire); lately to hand in advertising 'blurb' for **** masonry is the statement . . \"home designers are finding it necessary to achieve a \"naturalism\" in the elements which comprise the complex.\" . . . naive, and meaningless. This is a plea for the use of precise language — the sooner we discard \"naturalism\" the better, but unfortunately it looks contagious.",
