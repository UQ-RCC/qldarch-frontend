INTERVIEW WITH BRUCE WOLFEDATE 26 SEPTEMBER 2013JG	00:00:05	So, today’s the 26th of September 2013, we’re at 400 George Street in Brisbane, interviewing Bruce Wolfe, and interviewing you is myself, Janina Gosseye and about to join us is John Macarthur.00:00:18	So, as I said, what we’d like to focus on is your student years at University of Queensland, so, what architecture qualifications did you gain, when and from which institutions, is our first question.BW00:00:29	Okay, so there was University of Queensland and Bachelor of Architecture in about 1976, but it was also around the time of a new degree being introduced for the first three years, Bachelor of Design Studies.  And, on that traditional year out, that we always used to do, we just had to do some supplementary course work or study during that year to upgrade out first three years of the Bachelor of Architecture, to be awarded our Bachelor of Design Studies.JG00:00:58	Okay.  I thought you got the Bachelor of Design Studies in’73.BW00:01:01	I finished the first three years at university and then there was another bit of course work to be done during the year out and I think it was actually awarded in 1975.JG00:01:12	Nineteen seventy-five, so, which year did you start at UQ?BW00:01:15	Nineteen seventy-one.JG00:01:17	Seventy-one, and the Bachelor of Design Studies came after the Bachelor of Architecture?BW00:01:22	No, the Bachelor of Architecture was a five year course, plus a year out, so I got that in 1976.JG00:01:28	Yes.  Okay.  And, what was the Bachelor of Design Studies, what did that entail and how did that come about?BW00:01:35	Well, I guess it was just that it was being introduced at that time as the short undergraduate course for architecture, and later become the base course and then the last two years being the Master of Architecture.  And, we were at that transition period where it changed from being Bachelor of Architecture only to the introduction of that course.00:01:58	So, it was really after the fact that we were given the Bachelor of Design Studies.  But, they did ask us to do just  little bit more work after the first three years to make it a bachelor course.JG00:02:09	Okay.  And, what was the curriculum like for that course?BW00:02:15	Like now, it was a period where, I guess, the industry wasn’t doing that well.  And, I think in response to that, it was a very broad course really, in design, and a lot of people that did that course ended up doing vastly different things, but still in the field of design, whether it was photography or film making or art in general. 00:02:38	So, there was certainly a steady core of architecture running through it but you could bend that course quite a bit to make it a broader, more graphic arts course.JG00:02:53	And, you said you related that change in the course more to that the profession wasn’t doing well, do you think it was more instigated by the students that were before you, or do you think it related to the - - -BW00:03:03	Yeah, I mean the student reviews, the architecture reviews had been going on for quite some time with Ralph Tyrrell and others before that time and I think there was a broadening of an understanding of what an architecture course might be and by that time we started, it was a different course, very much, to the one that would have been in existence five years earlier.00:03:24	But, I think too, the expectation that all of those graduates were going to just go into architecture, but it wasn’t there.  Morning John.JM00:03:36	Hello Bruce, sorry to be late.  BW00:03:36	That’s all right.  Dr Macarthur has joined the conversation.JG00:03:43	The only question I asked was about the education so far, and I’ve written a few answers down.    So, it was in 1972, your second year, that this Art Week was organised, were there any other activities organised in the first year that were similar to - you started in 1971.BW00:04:01	There was no Art Week in the same way.  We were introduced to other things like pottery and life drawings classes and things like that, in the first year, life drawing I think is something that probably went way back in architecture.  But, maybe the potter was something different and I think that was perhaps instigated by Peter O’Gorman wanting to get a more touchy feely approach to design.JM00:04:27	So, you were in the social sciences building then?BW00:04:29	Yeah.JM00:04:30	And there was a pottery workshop down the line.BW00:04:31	That’s right.  Yeah.  And, we all had to, not only make tiles or something, pottery tiles, I’m not sure whether they ever did glorify the wall down there with our tiles.  But, on arrival in the course, there was  a whole lot of raw materials just stacked in the room.  Chipboard and 2 x 2 timber and pegs, with holes in the 2 x 2, so, there was some directions on how to construct your own workstation, or study booth.00:05:01	And, so in the first couple of weeks that was one of the projects.  So, it was a different kind, of course, I actually started at QUT six weeks earlier because I got a cadetship to go to QUT which was worth a lot more money than the scholarship to go to UQ.  But, yeah, I found the excitement at UQ was at a higher lever than that a QIT at that time.JM00:05:27	How did you know, did you have friends who’d gone to the university?BW00:05:29	Well, we only had – not all this is going to be useful – but we only had very few contact hours at QIT, you know, you’re at work for some of the hours and I can remember one of the three hours sessions was learning to draw a brick.  Now, if you hadn’t already learnt to draw a brick, or if you needed three hours tuition to draw it it probably wasn’t the school for me, I felt.JG00:05:56	But, it was more the curriculum at UQ than what was happening around?BW00:06:00	Two things, I guess, I wasn’t ready to take a job in somewhere like project services, in the public works department, and whilst that was interesting I probably didn’t think that it was the right time for me to be working and being in such a tight environment.  And, the idea of being a full time student, even for less money, was somewhat more attractive.JM00:06:23	What was student life like at St Lucia there.  I mean, were there – I guess was it a vibrant social scene with the clubs and societies?BW00:06:29	Well, it’s a time – well, yeah, it was a social scene but also highly politicised, you know the Springbok Tour might have been in ’72, but even in ’71 there was a lot of action against the government of the time, being a very right wing government and civil liberties were a key issue.JM00:06:52	And, was there as much about Springbok and the right to march demonstrations or was the Vietnam war still an issue.BW00:06:59	Vietnam war was still an issue.  I think Gough Whitlam came in in ’72, yeah, so there was certainly a long protest march from the campus through to the city.  There was also the Aquarius Festival, down in Canberra, that a lot of students went to.  I think that was ’71 – 1972.JM00:07:22	Did you go to the Aquarius Festival?BW00:07:24	Yeah.JM00:07:25	Can you tell us about that?BW00:07:28	Memory – but it was more to do with music than anything else.  There were political rallies there as well, and it was more about music and art and it was a pretty broad spectrum of both.  It was through that engagement, I guess, that as students in ’72, we decided to go down to the Sunbury Music Festival, which had an accompanying, architecture festival too.  00:08:04	We decided to design our own shelter and take it down, which got nicknamed the Million Dollar Duck, but it started out made of revolutionary material, probably urethane in a compressed form, and there was this company that wanted to develop that as a building material and it all sounded very exciting and we started making the panels.  But, the problem was there life span was only, like, a week before they started to lose their structural integrity.   So, it was exciting times.00:08:36	But, we made this octagon or something, that had a tower in the centre, but all, more or less, of the same shaped pieces.  So, these little legs that came out were the sleeping berths, and there was much like a tepee centre in the middle.  In the end we made it out of composite material, it was polystyrene and  FC, I think, on the outside.   Perhaps it was Perspex on the ends of those little sleeping - - -JM00:09:04	Who was with you in that group?BW00:09:07	Rick Sale and Mick Witty, Kerry Spencer,  Matt [00:09:15].JM00:09:19	And, with all of the social protests and the general  life over that period, did you have an impression that architecture itself would change because of those things?BW00:09:27	Very much so.JM00:09:28	You thought the profession would be different when you graduated than - - -BW00:09:32	Yeah.  It was also coming up to the fuel crisis too, so there was a – and [Small Turnatives 00:09:37] was established, I think, in 1972 or 1973 all about trying to reduce the energy burden that the building industry  placed on the planet and pollution burden that the construction industry placed on the planet.00:09:52	And, in fact, a couple of our assignments were exactly that, on, what were the projected limits to growth and Limits to Growth was a book that just came out around about that time, by [00:10:03], so there were a lot of scenarios - - -JM00:10:04	There was an [00:10:05] shop in ’73 wasn’t there?BW00:10:08	Could have been, you’re the researcher John.  But...JM00:10:12	It’s a mutual project.BW00:10:14	That sort of time scale though.  But, yeah, we were very much concerned with environmental issues.  And, Silent Spring might have been written towards the end, it might have been the late ‘60s or something like that.00:10:29	So, there was a lot of – and Steve Szokolay I think joined staff around about ’72, would that have been right?JM00:10:38	Yes.BW00:10:39	Yeah.  So, there are a number of things all happening at the same time that made you rethink what architecture really was about.  And, Dome Book 1 and Dome Book 2 came out, Shelter, all those sort of soft alternate magazine type books that were so different from the text books that we might have been studying.JG00:10:59	And, was there also a move to more of what was being built in Queensland before Queensland’s history or the Queensland house, was that also being looked at in your course.BW00:11:10	It was, that was probably a bit later on, although there was a residential component that ran all the way through and Peter O’Gorman was joined by Brett Anderson, probably in 1973 – ’74, but Peter O’Gorman had a real feel for architecture that responded to the local climate and a re-examining of the vernacular and, you know, the edges of the building, all those sorts of things that people talk about now.00:11:37	But, probably hadn’t been that properly explained maybe earlier.  Peter really had  an attachment to engagement with the climate for the buildings and architecture to engage with what really is a benevolent climate.JM00:11:56	There seems through a more varied interview, someone was telling us that the idea that the Queensland house is because it’s heavy in prefabrication and system build aspects was seen as a precursor to modernism and that idea was being put about, I think, by Bill Carr, back in the late ‘60s.BW00:12:16	No, I didn’t go to that discussion sorry.JM00:12:18	No?BW00:12:21	I mean the vernacular has got a lot going for it, except that you end up with a very dark interior to the house, when you start the verandas on every window, and the windows were only relatively small, in the middle of the house and [00:12:34].JM00:12:35	And, that’s the kind of critique that Langer made back in the ‘40s and they really powered the Hayes and Scott houses and so on, the critique of the veranda and glare factors and that sort of stuff.  But, were you taught about modernism in Queensland, like, were Hayes and Scott held as the exemplars of domestic design?BW00:12:55	Yeah, I can remember looking at those examples at that time.  But, whether or not it was a key part of the course, probably not, but there was the end of modernism, but there was also the start of post modernism while I was still at uni, it put a pediment on everything and lots of pinks and blues and I think Sterling at that time might have been [00:13:21] - - -JM00:13:21	A bit like, you’ve worked at that time, yeah.JG00:13:25	So, what were you looking at, were you looking at Archigram and groups like that, or was that being taught or not as much?BW00:13:30	There was Archigram and - - -JM00:13:36	Super studio?BW00:13:37	Yeah.  Yeah.  So, it was all – I mean, second year, before Expo, we built an enormous dome, geodesic dome, it was really quite big and also an enormous inflatable that we - in the middle of the Great Court, in fact, and much to the entertainment of the engineering students who thought that if anyone was going to be doing big things it should have been them, but this might have been 25 – 30 metres long and ten metres tall.00:14:15	And, we knew that pumping it up was going to be an issue because if a little bit of breeze got onto it then it would form big waves, and so we started very early in the morning.  But, we undersized the pumps, I guess, and we had to abort because we couldn’t hold it down into shape while the breeze came and made these huge waves and people were being thrown in the air by the wave action of this inflatable.  So, we did the next morning, started even earlier.  It was all up by the time the engineering students came to criticise.  So, it was a pretty nice time.  00:14:48	So, getting – the reason I brought that up was, it was about investigating different building methods and it was about recycling too, the airlocks for those things came from recycled materials, and the geodesic dome, we made a few cardboard ones just to get all the geometry right.  Because it was all long hand maths as well, no computers, and then we made this steel framed one and one of the people I knew, Mick [00:15:16], his father had a steel fabrication shop.  So, one weekend we went in there and cut and pressed all of the metal rod and punched the holes in the ends and started the base.00:15:27	It was a 25 foot dome, it was a decent sized thing, it was used as the theatre for the University Theatre Company, for at least one or two shows and it had a suspended plastic skin - - -JG00:15:43	And, where was that built?BW00:15:45	In front of the Fulton Smith building.JM00:15:51	Were you looking at - - -BW00:15:52	And, then we moved it down to – adjacent to one of the ovals for it to be the theatre and we should have understood when six or eight of us could pick it up that it probably needed to be held down when it was in place.  It was reasonably light for that sized building.  And, sure enough one evening a strong wind did come and moved it three or four feet along while people were inside, so, that’s, you know, you learn some things.JG00:16:24	You mentioned at the beginning the Architecture Review, and they were still going when you started?BW00:16:29	I think the last one might have been in 1971 or 1970, but my brother was a uni, he was a musician, and he was involved in the architecture of it, although he did science.JG00:16:43	And, did you attend the last one or were you too late?BW00:16:46	No.JG00:16:48	So, my questions are now mostly about Art Week, you already mentioned Alby [00:16:59], do you remember what he was doing and which other artists participated and what the events were, what was set up?BW00:17:07	Yeah, well it was long awaited and highly anticipated.  Because, these weren't consequential artists, you know, they were really quite of their time.  So, for Bill Carr to be able to secure their services for the week was really quite something.  And, so it – I think it was in the Masonic – it started in the Masonic Hall down in Alice Street, was it Alice Street?JM00:17:32	Alice Street, yeah.BW00:17:32	And, because it was being filmed by a crew at the university as well, and I think that’s where the trouble might have started.JM00:17:44	So, who was the film crew?JG00:17:47	The university.JM00:17:47	The university itself or students?BW00:17:48	The university.  Yeah.  Yeah.  JG00:17:51	It was filmed by staff, by UQ students?BW00:17:54	I know there was a film unit within the university.JM00:17:56	There’s a photography unit which – did it have film capacity or something?BW00:18:01	Yeah, the details of that are well beyond me.  But - - -JM00:18:03	It would be very interesting to find that.JG00:18:04	Yes.JM00:18:05	It’s probably been burnt.BW00:18:06	But, that was exactly what the first activity was, was the one that was a little controversial I suppose.JG00:18:13	The induction event by Tim Johnson, was the one?BW00:18:18	So, are we talking about that are we?JM00:18:21	Yes please.BW00:18:25	From memory, we were asked to lie down, on our backs, and close your eyes, and without any physical stimulus, just using your imagination, attempt to have an erection or whatever, whatever you might say to yourself.  But, the film crew were – maybe it was being filmed and it was also being on monitor down in their film van or something, something ,  like that, and a little way into that someone decided that this wasn’t really what uni students should be doing, and it was way out of line with what the curricula might have to be.00:19:10	So, the actual shunning of it probably happened at the end of the day, but it was during that day that – you know, some people were particularly of a religious bent, maybe, and they found it offended their delicate sensibilities and then the university may have thought that they may run into other problems if it continued along this way for a week.00:19:37	So, I think the school was closed down the next day – the Architecture School was closed down and Architecture Week was cancelled.  But, even without social media, enough message got out that it was being transferred up to a house in Tamborine and there were other activities that were filmed there as well.  Unusual ways to wear your underwear, there are probably photographs of that somewhere, but I don't have them.JG00:20:07	And, it was for all years or it was – that had to participate in Art Week, or was it - - -BW00:20:13	I can’t really recall.  Certainly we had a fair contingent there, it may have been just the lower school, I can't recall more senior members of the student body  being there.JG00:20:26	And, did other staff members, apart from Bill Carr, participate?  Were there others there?BW00:20:31	I’m sure there were other  lecturers there, but, I mean, he’s the one that stands out because he organised it.  But, Bill Greig found out about it, whether he was there or not I’m not sure, but he was head of school at the time, and yeah, he was pretty upset by it.  I think the stress of that made him a little unwell.JM00:20:55	How did Bill Carr describe the event to you beforehand?  What did he say its aims were or - - -BW00:21:01	I think to introduce us to the front of art rather than just seeing art as something that was an historical – because, a lot of the courses that we did were, you know, the history of art, the history of this, the history of that.  So, his opinion wasn’t that history stopped and history continue right up to the present, which he’d be exposed to the more adventurous side of art.  He didn't say anything radical was going to happen, merely that we were going to participate in a week where art was considered not history but something of the making.JM00:21:39	And, had you been to any other performance arts events before then or - - -BW00:21:43	No.JM00:21:43	- - - happenings as they were called at the time?BW00:21:49	Yeah, there were happenings.  There were happenings down at the Aquarius Festival and Sunbury too.  They weren’t particularly directed like that.JG00:22:02	So, that was the first event that you had to participate in but it was only shut down, according to Fiona, she thought it was shut down on day three, not day one.BW00:22:10	Was it?JM00:22:11	Well, that’s what – I don’t know, but were there other things that you remember?BW00:22:12	Well, you’re talking about something over 30 years ago.JG00:22:17	Of course, but are there other things that you remember that took place?BW00:22:23	That was the most substantial thing that I can remember because it was just so unusual.  But,  I’m sure there were more mundane things that happened in that next few days.  But, the week actually continued to the end of the week, it just wasn’t sponsored by the university after day two or day one, whichever it was.JG00:22:41	And, there was only a small contingent of the students that participated?BW00:22:43	Yeah.JG00:22:44	And, do you remember any of what happened when you moved to Tamborine?BW00:22:50	I can’t remember a lot that happened at Tamborine.  It was – I was only there for one day and, you know, it was – the ‘70s was a time where you were smoking dope as well, so, whether or not that impairs your memory or just impairs your maturity at the time, I don’t know.JM00:23:13	What was the student reaction to it being suppressed entirely?  We’ve heard a bit about this from the other side, from Bal Saini who arrived and, not having had any role in it and having to clear up some of the mess.BW00:23:26	Yeah.JM00:23:27	And, we’ve heard a little about how the staff reacted to it.  But, we’ve not really – how did the students react to it having been shut down?BW00:23:35	Well, firstly, I guess the reaction to it happening was one of a very open mind, because it was a time when, you know, a lot – the whole idea of education was getting broader I think, and what happened at university is the social responsibilities that we foresaw a being things that a student should be taking on. 00:23:59	So, this was just part and parcel of how education was and it was very poor.  So, when it was shut down, to me it seemed a little nonsensical, I mean, just let it run its course, what harm was being done.00:24:16	I guess what concerned me more was what was going to happen to the lecturers who had organised it or those that opposed it and how much conflict there might have been within the department and how something that I didn't take that seriously, could actually easily lead to very serious consequences, which I think it inevitably did, but, I think it was only because it was closed down that it would have had those bigger reactions, if it was just left to continue, certainly some people would have been upset because they would have seen it as not in line with their Christian values or something.  But, I don't think it would have got to the same sort of conflict that it eventually did.JM00:25:05	So, you didn’t see it as part of a symptom of  wider reaction against the ‘60s and against experimentation.  Was it a returned order kind of moment?BW00:25:18	No, I didn't John actually.   It may have been seen by that from the other side, but, there was – if we looked at the government that was in place in Queensland at the time, that was an authoritarian government, Joe Bjelke Peterson introduced, you know, two people stand together and talk on the pavement because there was a new law being brought in that that was an assembly.  It could lead to a riot.  Whether  it was two or five, I don't know the number.00:25:45	So, there was, what you could have seen as draconian measures being taken by the government, but in reaction to a new order, if you like.  So, if that was happening in government level – I didn't really see the treatment or the closing down of Art Week as a similar thing to that, I just saw it as a response to some things that a lot of people may find offensive.  I didn’t see it as a closing down or a trying to narrow down the cause.JG00:26:21	So, that didn’t happen at all after.  Where there changes in how the first was run?  Because, Bill Carr had some strange educational methods, according to what we’ve been told.  Were there changes in what you were taught or how you were taught after?BW00:26:36	No, I don’t really think so.  I can remember, shortly after that, there was – he ran or he was involved in a course, anyway, which was re-enactment of the Bauhaus, so you all had to play act – you were given a person to be, so you had to research what his attitude or philosophy might be.  And, I can’t even remember who I was supposed to have been at the time, but, we all took that on board reasonably well and I think, when you asked was there much modernist talk about the houses that were being built here, there was certainly discussion on modernism and through vehicles such as that.00:27:14	And, it didn't ever seem to me that there was a moving back towards trying to put people in a lecture theatre and having someone up the front talk at them.  I think it was still, you know, fairly broad.JM00:27:29	So, you really felt that the Art Week controversy was more of a hiccough in a process of elimination rather than the end of that process?BW00:27:35	Yeah.  I think so. And, I don’t know what’s happened after I left in ’75, but I didn’t find any of the further things that happened were designed to rein in the course.  When you get back from a year away, as we all did after third year, I think you felt a bit reined in then, but it was like, you had a year of total freedom and then suddenly you have to study again.00:28:07	Maybe there was a change of atmosphere there from 1974 to ’75.  But, I put it down to just having to sidle up and having the last two years were always considered  bit more - - -JM00:28:18	A more professional focus.BW00:28:20	- - - you know, this is preparing you for going out and being an architect.  In my case it prepared me to be a Jackaroo, but, it was fun.JG00:28:30	And, what do you remember of the other courses, because you said that the education you got was quite broad and it invited people to go into film making, photography, how was the course suited for – how did the course - - -BW00:28:44	Well, the last two years probably weren’t.  That was in the first three years, I think it was – well, we had animal behaviour as a lecture course, we had a psychologist there - - -JM00:28:56	McBride, yeah.BW00:28:57	Yeah, so there were just a variety of things that weren’t as mainline architecture as one would expect and there were photography courses and film courses too.  We used to have to hire out the Bell and Howell 16ml projector from the film [00:29:16].JM00:29:16	I think there was a reel to reel video tape machine quite early on, I played with it and [00:29:21].BW00:29:23	Yeah, I’m not sure whether video tape was there in ’71 – ’72.JM00:29:29	About that time.JG00:29:33	John, you were talking about, this kind of vehicle for - - -JM00:29:39	The bus, the famous bus.BW00:29:41	Well, that actually relates back to 1972 when we did go down to Sunbury, and on the way down there, I think we broke the trailer, it was just the building itself, the elements that were holding the trailer together, and so, when we came back we had to  ship that back on a train.  It just made us think that we did all go out to these places as a group, and we thought of buying a bus.00:30:12	We looked around Brisbane, we just thought of it as something to get around in, you know, as a group.  And, I think about that time there was somewhere in the States, there was a bus tour with a microphone on a boom and they could listen in to people’s conversations on the sidewalk and then transmit it to everyone in the street.00:30:31	I mean, there were just lots of experimental things happening.   We didn’t intend to do that, but,  maybe that’s why we thought a bus.  And, a couple of us went down to Sydney to look at the graveyard of the Sydney double deckers, and we found one that was in pretty good condition.  Then, a number of us went down and brought it back and I got a bus licence, I don’t think anyone else had a bus licence.00:30:57	So, there was a lot of driving involved and on the way back it broke down and we spent a bit of time in Tenterfield or somewhere, on the way back, and we were interviewed about what we were doing.  And, that made us think a little bit more seriously about what we were doing and we established a company called Mobile Design Research.00:31:20	What we thought we might be able to do was to take architectural services to country towns, this is as well as just getting around in the bus ourselves around the city.  But, to give it some legitimacy, you know, we could go there and do an exercise on their town centre, see the historic buildings, whether any of those could be adapted to be reused, or what things could be done to make their towns work.00:31:46	I know Esk was one of the subjects of our investigation.  We were looking there about whether we could introduce more alternate energy to the way they performed, I suppose.  They looked at methane generation through their sewage treatment plant.  Things that were all the rage in California I suppose, or Arizona.  We thought that we might be a vehicle for doing that.	JM00:32:14	So, who were the students and did you have support from the staff?BW00:32:17	We had interest from the staff, I not sure that we had support form the staff.  The office bearers might have been myself,  Dixon Andrews and Kerry Spencer.  And, the first real adventure, I think, was taking the students down to Sydney and you were – were you one of those first years students?  No?  JM00:32:45	Yes.  Yes.    I had a bus licence then, I was driving it.  It would have been second trip.BW00:32:52	Yeah.  So, yeah, so it actually  - - -JM00:32:57	It would have been '77.BW00:32:59	Okay.  So, it did a number of true things but, also, obviously a thing like that was a bit of a party class as well.JM00:33:09	Were there other community activist things that you were doing? Was that a focus of the course?  I mean, I remember in my first year we were suddenly building a kids playground in West End.  I don’t know how long that idea of activism had been going on.BW00:33:24	Yeah.  Well, Peter Bycroft was a great support of activism.  When I said I can’t remember any support, I think Peter Bycroft might have been a supporter, but he left, I forget what year.JM00:33:37	Later I think, late ‘70s early ‘80s.BW00:33:41	And, so, yeah,  he and Mary Maher, Mary might have set up small alternatives too, which was a kind of activism.  In terms of, I guess, do you look at energy saving as the grand gestures, but there’s also the leak plugging and belt tightening, saying that’s what small alternatives concentrate on.    Each person could make their small [00:34:06] change to - - -JG00:34:09	And, in your year there were some women students weren't there?BW00:34:15	No.  There was only one, Catherine Brouwer and she left in second year to go to a course in Tasmania.  The year after us there were Catherine Ferrier and Cathy Stone and a couple of others.  But, you weren’t surrounded by a lot of women.  But, I’m pretty sure there was only Cathy Brouwer in our year and that she left after either first or second year to go to a course in Tasmania.00:34:45	I don’t think it was because of us.  She changed to landscape architecture.JM00:34:53	Just thinking more about what else we can [00:34:54] on Art Week.  There was a lot of tension between the staff after that, you mention tension between Bill Greig and Bill Carr, but, right across the staff and to do with the university’s actions against Bill Carr.  BW00:35:10	Yeah.JM00:35:11	But, was there a lot of – were students aware of that, did it have an effect on your education beyond that?  Were you aware of factions amongst the staffBW00:35:21	John, I’m not sure I did.  I mean, Bill Carr had such a strong following after first year, because he was like a father figure.  Very, very concerned with individuals, as was Peter O’Gorman, they made a great team, very different people.  And, I think  [Art Year 00:35:38] came down hard on Art Week, I guess there was a schism between those students that he had fostered through the first year and himself and we could also see, I guess, the tensions in the staff.00:35:53	But, I’m not sure that we really took sides or barracked for one side or the other.  I really can’t think that there was a big movement in the students to either support either  Bill Carr or support Bill Grieg, it was really just supporting the freedom that we might have previously enjoyed.  I think most students would have through that the furore over  Art Week was far beyond that which it warranted and, had it just been let go ahead, yes, there would have been people offended, as there could have been people offended by any number of things, but, I guess we thought it wouldn’t have been such a big thing.JG00:36:40	And, didn’t Bill Carr build this ecological sun – solar house, was that when you were there or was that before you arrived?JM00:36:51	It was with Peter O’Gorman, he built a solar house with some engineer he got hold of quite early, thing with [00:36:58] on the roof and - - -JG00:37:01	That was earlier.BW00:37:01	Yeah, I can’t remember.  My final architecture project, not my thesis but my architecture project,  was on embodied energy in building and so, it’s really interesting to see now, we’re just trying to do that again, working out where the energy levels are in building, like, can you use aluminium?  Well, yes you can because it’s quite efficient but it’s very high in its energy use and trying to balance the work a material can do, it’s recyclability with how much energy it uses to create in the first place.00:37:34	There wasn’t nearly enough data available to make it a worthwhile exercise in 1975, but, certainly the thoughts were there, back in those times, about how we should be going about redressing this energy balance.JM00:37:57	I think we’re coming towards the end.  We’re hoping this process is going to continue, because, we’ve set up the data base and  the analytic tools to go beyond 1975, but, I don’t know when that will happen or who will be doing it, but, seeing we’ve got the mike on, do you want to say what happened next?BW00:38:24	After 1975?JM00:38:26	You went off to be a jackaroo did you?BW00:38:27	Yeah, I didn’t have a huge interest in being an architect, I’d done six years of very interesting studies.  Some in architecture and some, as you point out, in extra curricula activities, and yeah, the first job I got after coming back, after being a jackaroo, was with the Queensland Arts Festival.  There’s a friend of mine, John Watson, who was art director and he ended up being the artistic director for this vessel, it was just at the break of Warana and the Crafts Festival, kind of thing, so they wanted to do a festival that was, yeah, just arts with a bit of crafts, as distinct from Warana with the floats and girls in bikinis and things.00:39:16	So, we were let loose with King George Square, and a very limited budget, and we made structures out of scaffolding for both displays and stage and things like that, with John Watson, he was designing the activities, I guess the performances.  00:39:39	It was quite an incredible time to be able to just drive your car to the middle of King George Square at night and start spray painting the scaffolding.  You know, now, you’d have to have scaffolding around the scaffolding to paint it, and there you were just holding onto scaffolding with one hand  and a spray gun in the other, so it was all neat and white, but still looked quite strange, the sculpture nearly  of scaffolding.00:40:04	We wanted to make it a lot taller than it was but didn’t ever get a chance.  But, that was a project – I was probably engaged by the Queensland Festival of Arts, but also UQ and we were – second year students or something, joined us, so that was Michael Garman and others, Dan [Joyce 00:40:26] one of them - - -JM00:40:27	He was my year, yeah.  I don’t think I got involved in that project.BW00:40:29	So, there were three people I think, and Richard Foster.  And, yeah, we, I guess designed it, we built a model and all those sorts of things,  and we physically put a lot of it together and it was great.JM00:40:46	But, you were skirting around being an architect in the commercial professional sense.BW00:40:49	Yeah.  Yeah.JM00:40:50	Were you looking for other ways to use your expertise, more community art and - - -BW00:40:54	Yeah.   Yeah.  Well, I got a job with the Popular Theatre Troupe as well as a designer, rather than an actor, but also set up the Red Hill Community Arts Centre, which was just, I guess, both and arts pursuit and a community pursuit.  We ran activities for after school kids, where, both parents might have been working, this was a new thing then, there were a lot of, just kids on the street, if you like.  And, we ran old movies and things like that of an afternoon, but, we were also the home of the Popular Theatre Troupe.  00:41:36	So, I did the designs for the set.  They were a travelling theatre company, so, that was a lot of fun, designing sets that could easily be transported in a couple of vans.JM00:41:49	So, how did you find your way, eventually, back into the profession?BW00:41:55	Well, I can actually draw, I mean freehand draw, and not all architects could rattle up a perspective that looked half reasonable and I was just walking down the street and a colleague from my same year just asked me what I was doing, and whether I could come a do a couple of drawings for them, and I can’t even remember what the buildings were.00:42:19	One was a theme park, a water theme park.  So, it wasn’t a traditional kind of perspective that you might think. And, so I went in and drew those and they offered me a job and what surprised me was, things like the Popular Theatre Troupe, I think I was putting in as much money as I get paid, whereas with a job in an architect’s office, I just seemed to make money.  00:42:45	Not, that it was a lot of money, it was a lot of money in comparison to working in the arts.  And, I didn’t find it that offensive, I suppose, to do.  Although, I didn’t find it that amazingly enjoyable, but I thought I had to give it at least a couple of years.JM00:43:03	What was the offensive you thought you might have found, yourself and people like you, you’re not alone, I mean, was it the culture of the profession or the idea of - - -BW00:43:12	No, I think it was more that – highly suspicious of the building industry and the way money was used to create buildings that weren’t actually part of a social fabric.  You know, the buildings were becoming to be ways of making money, so, the investor built a building themselves, parts of it, rather than it being, you know, something that the owner needs and wants.  It became a tool for making money and I didn’t think that that was such a great idea.00:43:45	And, I know that’s probably been what it’s been for a long time.  But, I guess I could be seen as more idealistic then than I am now.JM00:43:54	So, it really was about the ethics of capitalism and building that has a social definition - - -BW00:43:58	That and I thought, perhaps, I was more aligned with the arts industry than the architectural industry.  And, then I joined the most conservative practice in the town.JM00:44:16	Bruce, thanks very much.JG00:44:18	Thank you.END OF TRANSCRIPT6
